## Manual Installation

The system is not yet listed in the official Foundry VTT package browser. Install it manually using the steps below.

### Option A — Install from release zip

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Leetram519/Project-Moon-TTRPG/releases) and download the latest `system.zip`. If no releases are available currently, please check back later, or build it yourself from source.
2. Extract the contents into your Foundry data directory:
   ```
   <foundryData>/Data/systems/projectmoonttrpg/
   ```
3. Restart Foundry VTT if it was already running.
4. Create or open a World and select **Project Moon TTRPG** as the game system.

### Option B - Install from manifest URL

This is not yet possible. We're working on it, and it'll come with the MVP 1.0.0 release.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Leetram519/Project-Moon-TTRPG.git
cd Project-Moon-TTRPG

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build the system (compiles SCSS → CSS and assembles output files)
npm run build
```

Once built, copy or symlink the output directory into your Foundry data folder:

```bash
# Linux / macOS — symlink (recommended for active development)
ln -s /path/to/Project-Moon-TTRPG/dist ~/.local/share/FoundryVTT/Data/systems/projectmoonttrpg

# Windows — copy manually or use mklink in an Administrator terminal
mklink /D "C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT\Data\systems\projectmoonttrpg" "C:\path\to\Project-Moon-TTRPG\dist"
```

Then restart Foundry VTT.
